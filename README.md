<h1> AI Inspirit Scholars Program </h1>
<h2> Description</h2>
During this program, I learned about different AI models such as neural networks, K-nearest neighbors, Logistic regression, and Linear regresssion. Me and a team of my peers studied how effective these different AI models would be in detecting pneumonia in patient scans (with a data set of 100 scans) and presented our findings.
